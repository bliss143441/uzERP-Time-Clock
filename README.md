#uzERP Time Clock

uzERP Time Clock is a web app time clock, perfect for allowing employees to clock in and out of work. Easy remote access to the software allows for perfect administration no matter where the unit is placed.

The application will allow input from any keyboard like device, for example a barcode scanner, magnetic strip reader or a basic numeric keyboardâ€¦ basically anything that can input characters and the hit return at the end.
